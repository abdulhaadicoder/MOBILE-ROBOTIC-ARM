note in my code the ir code send by my remote  for the movement of servo is different from your ir remote so you must decide which button make this movement and  sniff the code i will leave a sniff code above 
#i will add the vidoe on the issue tab since iam new to github if anybody  knows how to add a vidoe on the readme file pls letme know
# i use popsicle for the body it is fully DIY and easy to build
